Auto interact with a flight master to fly to a specific spot. Macro pushed after interacting:

/script SelectGossipOption(1); TakeTaxiNode(1)

The first number is selecting which chat button you wish to select. Most often this will lead to the flight path selection window. 
If you have a quest for the flight master or any other interaction choice it will respond awkwardly.

The second number is the node you’re flying to. It’s indexed so it may change depending on flight path availability. 
Ie obtaining a new path may take the place of that specific index number. 
To get a name output of the selected index you can do a print TaxiNodeName(#) with the flight path panel open. 
This will output what wow calls it, not what you may call it.
