This Macro checks whether or not you have your Insignia equipped. If not, it will try to turn into bear form and function like usual. 
If you do have your Insignia equipped, but you are not in combat, it will just turn you into bear form too, just like usual. 
But if you meet both conditionals of having your insignia equipped AND being in combat, it will use the Insignia right before trying to go into bear form.
