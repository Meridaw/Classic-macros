Flags you to PvP if you aren’t yet, then it unflags you from PvP. 
If your PvP timer is already counting down, it won’t flag you for PvP again. This allows for your PvP timer to expire while your AoE is going on.

#showtooltip
/script local s = math.floor(GetPVPTimer()/1000); if s == 301 then SetPVP(1); else UIErrorsFrame:AddMessage("PvP Seconds: " .. s, 1, 1, 0, 53, 1); end SetPVP(false);
/use Consecration(Rank 1);


If at any point you want to stop AoEing to go AFK, you’ll know when you should do that. 
It tells you how many seconds you have left in PvP mode in your error frame every time you press it! You just keep AoEing until that timer is almost out. 
Happy defending!
