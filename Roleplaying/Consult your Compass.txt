This macro, you guessed it, shows your compass bearings as an emote, North, Northwest, etc. 
It is useful if you are playing without the minimap like a crazy person. 
Unlike the other macros do not change anything in this one, as it is exactly the maximum number of characters a macro can hold without mods.
