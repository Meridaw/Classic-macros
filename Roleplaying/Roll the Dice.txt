Roll the Dice

/e rolls a pair of worn bone dice.
/run C_Timer.After(1, function() SendChatMessage("rolls a "..random(1,6).." and a "..random(1,6)..".", "emote") end)

This macro will yield two random numbers from 1 to 6 as emote text. Feel free to change the first line to describe the dice differently.
