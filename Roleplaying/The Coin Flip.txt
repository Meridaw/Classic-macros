The Coin Flip

/point
/e casually flips a gold coin.
/run C_Timer.After(1, function() SendChatMessage(GetRandomArgument("catches the coin face up, heads.","catches the coin facedown, tails."),"emote") end)


This macro will cause your character to do the point animation and show the result of a coin toss as emote text. 
The coin has an equal random chance of landing on heads or tails. 
Feel free to change the second line to describe the coin differently.
