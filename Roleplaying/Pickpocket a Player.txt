Pickpocket a Player

This macro will make it seem like you have pick-pocketed another player for a small amount of gold. 
I didn't write this one myself, its a classic. I was testing it in retail, and someone actually believed it was real! 
Feel free to remove the shadowmeld line or change it to a rogue's stealth. 
I feel like the stealth sound and animation help to sell the illusion.
