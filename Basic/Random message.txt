Assign a random number to a variable, e.g. /run MyVar = random(0, 9); the random function takes a start and end number and will return a random number within that range.

You can have a list of things you’d like to say, such as, MyList = ["Hello", "Hey", "What's up?", "Yo!"];

Where, if you call the greeting at the index in that list, you will get the greeting you’d expect. For example MyList[0] is “Hello”, MyList[1] is “Hey”, and so on…

However, if you call MyList[100] or any other value that is not an index of the list, then you will get nothing returned.

Using that, you should be able to do what you want to do. Here’s a more complete example to point you in the right direction:


NOTE: I’ve used 0 through 10 for the range, so this should usually not send a message.

/run randNum = random(0, 10); 
/run myList = {"Hello","Hey","What's up?","Yo!"};
/run SendChatMessage(myList[randNum], "SAY");


You could also do that in 1 line, if you prefer. Also I think /script is an alias for /run or vice versa, but they seem to do the same thing:

/script randNum = random(0, 10); myList = {"Hello","Hey","What's up?","Yo!"}; SendChatMessage(myList[randNum], "SAY");
