You can get rid of a lot of spaces in macros. Any space after ; , ] can safely be removed.

/use is the same as /cast for spells.

Just have #showtooltip don't specify which ability, and it will change tooltip based on the one it will cast first (icon changes too).

If you use [] that will always use the spell because the conditions are always met.

Macro editing window can be brought up by typing /m in the chat window.

/stopmacro Stops the execution of the macro past this line.

/script UIErrorsFrame:Hide() Disables the red error messages “Out of range”, “Not in line of sight”, etc.

/castsequence is buggy and the macro can randomly stop working without any error popups or feedback. If this happens to you, doing /reload will fix it.

Shift clicking the item with the cursor in the macro window will paste the exact name there for you, so no worries with spelling errors.

help includes exists so you can cut it.
