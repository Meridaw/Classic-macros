Here are several common ways accessing these vars and commands:

wtf files - Config.wtf, in 'WTF', in WoW folder, stores game settings, like 'gxResolution', and 'locale' for the language.

/console command - chat slash command to run a base game script command, like setting a CVar.

wow.exe -Console - allows you to open "the console" in-game, opening and closing by using ~ key.

Configuration UI - WoW's normal in-game configuration interface. Hit Esc to get to it.

SetCVar() - WoW global API for changing settings using Macros or AddOns.

Warning: changing CVars directly can cause issues. Like changing 'cameraDistanceMax' in Config.wtf may render the "Max Camera Distance" slider useless. In some cases you may have to quit the game, and manually remove the CVar line from the .wtf file. Any changes done though CVars are generally the same as setting them through the game Configuration UI and will be saved.
